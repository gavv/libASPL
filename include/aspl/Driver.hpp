//! Plugin driver.
//!
//! Driver is the top-level object of AudioServer plugin. It contains Plugin
//! object, which is the root of the whole object hierarchy. The driver's job
//! is to receive requests from HAL and redirect them to appropriate objects.
//!
//! Driver is exposed to HAL as "driver reference" (@c AudioServerPlugInDriverRef).
//! The driver reference is actually a pointer to pointer to "plugin driver interface"
//! (@c AudioServerPlugInDriverInterface), which is a struct with a bunch of function
//! pointers for various operations (mostly for property dispatch and I/O).
//!
//! Driver fills this struct with its private functions. Each of them just finds
//! the registered object by ID and redirects operation to it. Objects are searched
//! in Context::Dispatcher. Every object requires Context as constructor argument
//! and automatically registers and unregisters itself in Dispatcher.
//!
//! By default driver creates its own Context and Plugin objects, but you can
//! provide your own if desired.
//!
//! After constructing driver, you need to use GetReference() method to obtain
//! the "driver reference" and return it from the plugin entry point, like:
//!
//! @code
//!   extern "C" void* MyEntryPoint(CFAllocatorRef, CFUUIDRef typeUUID)
//!   {
//!     if (!CFEqual(typeUUID, kAudioServerPlugInTypeUUID)) {
//!       return nullptr;
//!     }
//!     static auto driver = std::make_shared<aspl::Driver>();
//!     return driver->GetReference();
//!   }
//! @endcode
//!
//! Don't forget do declare your entry point in Info.plist of the plugin.
